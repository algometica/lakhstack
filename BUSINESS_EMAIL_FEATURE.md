- ✅ Integrated `business_email` field into the form structure
- ✅ Implemented comprehensive email validation in `validateForm()` function
- ✅ Configured Formik `initialValues` to include the new field
- ✅ Designed professional UI with clear labeling and contextual help text

### 2. BusinessDetail Component (`/app/(routes)/view-listing/_components/BusinessDetail.jsx`)
- ✅ Enhanced to prioritize `business_email` over `created_by` email
- ✅ Implemented "Business Contact" labeling for professional presentation
- ✅ Added informative tooltips indicating the contact method
- ✅ Maintained full backward compatibility with existing listings
