# Business Email Feature Implementation

## Overview
Added a dedicated business email field to listings so each listing can have its own contact email, which is essential for admin-managed listings where multiple businesses are handled by a single admin account.

## Changes Made

### 1. Edit Listing Form (`/app/(routes)/edit-listing/[id]/page.jsx`)
- ✅ Added `business_email` field to the form
- ✅ Added email validation in `validateForm()` function
- ✅ Added the field to Formik `initialValues`
- ✅ Created professional UI for the email input with proper labeling and help text

### 2. BusinessDetail Component (`/app/(routes)/view-listing/_components/BusinessDetail.jsx`)
- ✅ Updated to prioritize `business_email` over `created_by` email
- ✅ Added "Business Contact" label when business email is present
- ✅ Added tooltip showing which email will be contacted
- ✅ Maintains backward compatibility with existing listings

## How It Works

### For Admins:
- When editing a listing, admins can now enter a specific business email
- This email will be displayed and used for contact purposes instead of the admin's email
- Each listing can have its own unique business contact email

### For Users:
- When viewing a listing, the "Contact Business" button will use:
  1. **Business email** (if provided) 
  2. **Created by email** (fallback for existing listings)

### Database:
- The `business_email` field is stored in the listing table
- Existing listings without business email continue to work using `created_by`
- No migration needed - graceful degradation

## UI Improvements
- Professional email input with validation
- Clear labeling: "Business Email" with description
- Proper grid layout maintains responsive design
- Validation ensures email format is correct

## Benefits
1. **Admin Flexibility**: One admin can manage multiple businesses with different contact emails
2. **Professional Presentation**: Each business has its own contact email
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing listings continue to work
4. **User Experience**: Clear indication of business vs admin contact
5. **Data Integrity**: Email validation ensures proper format

## Example Usage
```
Before: contact@adminaccount.com (admin's email for all listings)
After: bakery@sweetdelights.com (specific business email)
```

This feature enables proper business contact management while maintaining the admin-curated platform architecture.
